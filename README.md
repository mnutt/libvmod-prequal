# Varnish Module (VMOD) `prequal`

```vcl
// Place import statement at the top of your VCL file
// This loads vmod from a standard location
import prequal;

// Or load vmod from a specific file
import prequal from "path/to/libprequal.so";
```

### Constructor `prequal.director(STRING name)`

Creates a new director instance.

##### Arguments
* `name` - A name for this director instance (used in stats naming)

This spawns a background thread that periodically probes backends
to determine their health and load status.

#### Method `VOID <object>.set_probe_path(STRING path)`

Sets the HTTP path used for health check probes.

##### Arguments
* `path` - The URL path to use for probe requests (e.g. "/probe")

#### Method `VOID <object>.add_backend(BACKEND vcl_backend)`

Adds a backend to the director's pool.

##### Arguments
* `vcl_backend` - The VCL backend to add

##### Returns
* `Ok(())` if the backend was added successfully
* `Err(VclError)` if the backend was invalid or could not be added

#### Method `VOID <object>.remove_backend(BACKEND backend)`

Removes a backend from the pool.

##### Arguments
* `backend` - The VCL backend to remove

#### Method `BACKEND <object>.backend()`

Selects the best backend for the current request.

The selection is based on probe results (in_flight requests and latency).
Falls back to random selection if no probe results are available.

##### Safety
This function is marked unsafe because it returns a raw VCL_BACKEND pointer.

#### Method `BOOL <object>.healthy()`

Checks if the director has any valid probe results.

##### Returns
`true` if there are valid probe results, `false` otherwise

#### Method `VOID <object>.seed_probes()`

Triggers a probe fetch for every backend.

#### Method `VOID <object>.log_probes()`

Logs the current state of the probe table for debugging.

##### Arguments
* `ctx` - The VCL context for logging
